## 🚀 How It Works

The **AI Metrics Dashboard** features a simple yet powerful workflow:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Metrics data is fetched from multiple AI models via backend APIs.
2. **Data Processing**: The backend processes the raw data, converting milliseconds to seconds and organizing it into structured datasets.
3. **Visualization**: The frontend dynamically renders interactive charts using Chart.js to display metrics such as response time and accuracy.
